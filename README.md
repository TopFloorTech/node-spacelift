Aluminum Capsule
==========

A companion node module for the Drupal "aluminum" module and "spacelift" base theme.

## Installation

    npm install spacelift --save

## Usage

Full documentation is coming. In the meantime, the quickest way to get started is
to require all of the SASS assets in your main SASS file before you include
your site styles, like this:

    // Base grid settings and imports
    @import "spacelift/grid"
    
    // Base functions, mixing, and styles
    @import "spacelift"
    
    // Simple styles for basic HTML elements
    @import "spacelift/elements"

## Contributing

All help is appreciated, especially in the form of bug reports and pull requests.
